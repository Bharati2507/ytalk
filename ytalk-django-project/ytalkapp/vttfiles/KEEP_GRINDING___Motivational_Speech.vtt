00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
 All your excuses are lies, little lies that you think makes life easier, but they don't.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
 They're lies.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
 They don't make life easier.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
 It's going to tell you nice little things to try and steer you down the wrong path.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
 Don't listen to the lies.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
 And how do you stop the lies?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
 You stop the lies with the truth, that the truth is you have time.

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
 You have the skill, you have the knowledge and the support and the willpower and the discipline to get it done.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
 Character is the ability to carry out a resolution long after the excitement of the moment is passed.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
 Are you going to say you want to do something?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
 Do it for two weeks and then quit?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
 Like you did last year, like you did the year before last.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
 You say you want to lose weight, get in shape, get your business off the ground.

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
 And then turn around and party, get lit, drink alcohol, eat like crap, and continue to live below who you were created to be.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
 No, no, no, no.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
 It is time to go from mediocre to meteoric.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
 It is time to go from being counted out to being counted on.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
 You want to get better?

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
 Stop looking for a shortcut and go find your alarm clock.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
 Find your discipline and find your guts and your passion and your drive and find your will.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
 Every day is a new day, a new week, a new shot at life.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
 An opportunity to come out of the gate like a man possessed and attacked the day without mercy.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
 Today, I'm taking steps, I'm putting the pressure on, I am the aggressor, I am on the attack.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
 Because I will not stop.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
 No alarm clock needed, my passion wakes me up, my drive wakes me up, my determination wakes me up, my ability to be doing it.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
 Whatever I want, it wakes me up, what wakes you up, what drives you?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
 Why are you playing this game?

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
 You gotta begin with the end of my, so whatever your dream or your goal is, you gotta wake up every day to it.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
 You gotta go to bed with it.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
 Are you here while I'm telling you? You gotta read stuff.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
 The music you listen to, everything you do, gotta pour into that dream.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
 I didn't get to where I am.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
 I didn't get here being lazy.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
 I didn't get here being watching TV.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
 I didn't get here taking days off.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
 I partially know what it takes.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
 One day I made a decision that I'm nothing's enough.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
 I'm tired of being average.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
 I'm tired.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
 I'm tired of being good.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
 I'm tired.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
 I made a decision.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
 I'm nothing's enough.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
 It's show time.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
 It's all a piece of for greatness.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
 Cause the dream gets off for greatness.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
 That mean your okay will be in New York.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
 That ain't no man in your okay will be in your face.

02:55.000 --> 03:08.000
 The only thing that you can always, always 100% of the time control is the amount of effort that you put into each attempt.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
 That you can control every single time.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
 If you wrote that this is the class that you were signed up for, then be at every single class.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
 Make up in your mind.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
 I will not miss one class.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
 Every engagement I do.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
 I don't care what you've been in here.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
 When I show up, I'm bringing you the best version of Aaron Thomas.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
 No excuses.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
 As we begin to focus on developing ourselves, as we begin to elevate ourselves and not to follow the crowd.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
 Activating the thinker in us and disciplining and putting on hold the emotional part of ourselves.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
 Not easy, but through practice and practice and practice.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
 Practice makes improvement.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
 You can always better your best.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
 You can always go beyond anything that you have ever done.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
 And so all you're looking for are new breakthroughs through practice and practice.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
 You'll get better and better.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
 You can't be average in the election.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
 You can't be good in the election.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
 You can't be a good person in the election.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
 You can't be great.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
 Really in the election.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
 You gotta be phenomenal.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
 I want you to push for legend.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
 Every single day of my life.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
 Every single day.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
 I don't have days where I don't feel like it.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
 Why?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
 Because I'm calling on me.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
 My wife's calling on me.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
 My son's calling on me.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
 I don't have days to wait.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
 You've got to get up earlier.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
 You've got to stay up later.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
 You've got to execute.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
 And you've got to go from 70 to 120.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
 I know you want nothing more than to just sleep in today.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
 You just want five more minutes of sleep.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
 Just five minutes.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
 But I'm telling you, no.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
 You cannot do that.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
 Those five minutes are not worth bowing down to weakness.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
 Bowing down to procrastination.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
 Bowing down to the short term gratification.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
 Are those five minutes so great that you're willing to push back your dreams?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
 Push back your goals?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
 Push back everything you've always wanted?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
 No.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
 Don't allow it.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
 Don't allow those weak voices in your head to win.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
 If you allow those voices to win, you'll be a slave to them for the rest of your life.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
 Be strong.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
 Be powerful.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
 Get aggressive.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
 As soon as you feel that urge to crawl back in bed, get yourself up immediately.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
 This is where you win.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
 This is the first battle of the day.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
 This victory will establish your mindset for the next 24 hours.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
 So you've got to decide to destroy your weak feelings.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
 And do what you know you need to do.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
 Don't allow yourself to sleep in.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
 Don't allow yourself to take the easy path.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
 Don't allow yourself to falter.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
 Rise up and aggressively move forward.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
 Down the path toward victory.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
 If you're really going to be successful, if you're going to have it, if you're going to be it, you've got to take ownership of your life.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
 I want you to say the reason I'm not amazing yet is because I hit the snooze button.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
 I'm not amazing yet because I couldn't get up on time because I told myself I'm not a morning person.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
 I'm not amazing yet because I'd rather make excuses than make adjustments.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
 I choose to do what's convenient, not what is right.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
 When you can own up to that, you can change yourself.

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
 When you cut this off, I want you to go look in the mirror and promise yourself, from this day forward, I will become the very best version of it.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
 It's your dream.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
 If you're going to have it, get your ass up and make it happen.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
 If you're going to have it, you've got to work day and night to get it.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
 The difference between people who talk about it and people who do it is one simple word.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
 Application, they hear it, they learn it, then they actually start doing it consistently.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
 If you're not consistently moving forward and not consistently contributing each day, then of course you're not going to be happy with yourself.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
 It's that lack of daily consistency that ends up hurting our own self-esteem because everyone can show up and be great once in a while.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
 But to show up every single day of your life and not stray from executing on the task over and over, that takes discipline.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
 It's discipline to do the things you really don't want to do when you know you need to do.

06:59.000 --> 07:09.000
 Those who do it on a consistent basis because they demand that of themselves every day, those are the ones who achieve true confidence, true self-esteem, a true life of greatness.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
 Even if you're nervous, you've got to do it anyway.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
 Why?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
 Because the people who are living on purpose, the people at the top, they don't make excuses.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
 They make a way.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
 Even if you're not being encouraged, do it anyway.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
 Even if you're not being validated, do it anyway.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
 The question is, can you just be faithful in the small things?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
 Can you be consistent?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
 Can you be persistent?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
 Can you be committed in the dark?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
 Can you be steadfast?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
 Can you be unmovable?

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
 Speak life into that dream and say to yourself, I am determined, come hell or high water, to win.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
 From this day forward, all I do is win.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
 All I do is execute.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
 You've got to start it.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
 Then make up in your mind that you're not leaving until you finish it.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
 And if you can get to a point in your life where you finish everything you start, you're going to be miles ahead of everybody else.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
 I don't care how difficult it is.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
 I need you to finish.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
 I don't care how you feel.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
 I need you to finish.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
 I don't care if you feel defeated.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
 I need you to finish.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
 Get yourself on the path to health, the path to happiness, the path to success.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
 And that path is the path of discipline.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
 Get on it and get after it.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
 Yes, it's going to be hard.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
 Yes, it's going to suck.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
 But you've got what it takes.

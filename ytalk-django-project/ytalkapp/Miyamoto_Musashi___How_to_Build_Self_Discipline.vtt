00:05.300 --> 00:08.000
 that makes learning fun and rewarding.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.700
 Miyamoto Musashi was a samurai who went undefeated in 61 duels,

00:13.700 --> 00:18.200
 so it's safe to say that he knew something about building self-discipline.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.700
 And a week before he passed away, he wrote a short work called Dokodō,

00:22.700 --> 00:27.100
 which roughly translates to the way of walking alone.

00:27.100 --> 00:32.800
 And in it, Musashi laid out 21 principles for living a life of discipline.

00:32.800 --> 00:38.900
 In part one of this series, we'll go over the first five principles in Musashi's Dokodō.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.400
 Musashi's first principle states,

00:41.400 --> 00:44.600
 Accept everything just the way it is.

00:44.600 --> 00:49.200
 When you refuse to accept things the way they are, you become delusional.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.800
 And when you become delusional, you lose the ability to act effectively in the world.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.800
 And when you lose the ability to act effectively in the world,

00:58.800 --> 01:04.100
 life becomes more painful for you, because everything you do results in failure.

01:04.100 --> 01:07.700
 Success requires us to see the world clearly.

01:07.700 --> 01:13.800
 And to see the world clearly, you have to start by accepting reality as it is.

01:13.800 --> 01:20.300
 A discipline person accepts reality as it is, so they can learn to work with it, not against it.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.800
 Musashi's second principle says,

01:22.800 --> 01:26.300
 Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.

01:26.300 --> 01:32.300
 Making pleasure your highest goal is one of the quickest and surest paths to degeneration.

01:32.300 --> 01:39.800
 That's because the quickest and shortest paths to pleasure are often found in cheap, shallow, and unhealthy vices,

01:39.800 --> 01:44.800
 such as junk food, drugs, porn, mindless entertainment, and so on.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.800
 Things that are immediately pleasurable are often bad for our health.

01:48.800 --> 01:57.800
 And conversely, things that are painful at first, such as running, working out, or studying, are often good for us in the long run.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.800
 A discipline person doesn't seek pleasure for its own sake.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.800
 But rather, they seek out activities that challenge them to grow.

02:05.800 --> 02:12.300
 Activities which may be painful at first, but yield greater and deeper pleasure in the long run.

02:12.300 --> 02:17.300
 Musashi's third principle states, Do not, under any circumstances,

02:17.300 --> 02:19.800
 depend on a partial feeling.

02:19.800 --> 02:26.800
 If you feel partial about a decision, it means you feel some doubt in your mind about how to truly proceed.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.300
 So the best course of action is to not make a decision,

02:30.300 --> 02:34.800
 reserve your judgment, and not jump to any conclusions.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.800
 Keep exploring and looking for evidence of the truth until the feeling of doubt is resolved.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.800
 A discipline person listens to their body.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.800
 They measure twice and cut once.

02:46.800 --> 02:55.800
 They act only when they feel certain that the time for action has arrived, and so they don't make hasty and rash decisions.

02:55.800 --> 03:02.300
 Musashi's fourth principle states, Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.

03:02.300 --> 03:06.800
 Thinking of yourself too much is often a fruitless activity.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.300
 What will you get from thinking of yourself?

03:09.300 --> 03:10.800
 Will you become smarter?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.300
 Will you become more loving?

03:12.300 --> 03:14.800
 Will you become more competent?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.300
 Will you even know yourself better?

03:17.300 --> 03:21.300
 No, you will only become more vain and prideful.

03:21.300 --> 03:28.800
 The way to intelligence, love, competence, and even self-awareness comes through acting in the world.

03:28.800 --> 03:36.300
 You will understand yourself better and grow by seeing how your actions manifest themselves in the world.

03:36.300 --> 03:42.300
 You will understand yourself better when you see how your actions affect those around you,

03:42.300 --> 03:45.800
 not by spending time thinking about yourself.

03:45.800 --> 03:51.300
 A discipline person does not obsess over themselves, which is often a fruitless activity,

03:51.300 --> 03:56.800
 but rather they think deeply about the world and how their actions affect it.

03:56.800 --> 04:02.800
 Musashi's fifth principle states, Be detached from desire your whole life long.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.800
 The Buddha said that attachment was the source of suffering.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.800
 When you are attached to something that you don't have, you suffer the feeling of not having it.

04:12.800 --> 04:18.800
 And when you lose something that you were attached to, you suffer the feeling of losing it.

04:18.800 --> 04:26.800
 A discipline person has desires and wants things from the world, but they don't have any attachments to those desires.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.800
 If they can't have what they want, they accept it.

04:30.800 --> 04:36.800
 And so because they have no attachments, they don't suffer any more than they need to to grow.

04:36.800 --> 04:43.800
 So by living out the first five principles from Musashi's Dokodō, accept everything just the way it is.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.800
 Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.800
 Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.

04:51.800 --> 04:59.800
 Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world, and be detached from desire your whole life long.

04:59.800 --> 05:04.800
 If you follow these five principles, you can build up your self-discipline.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.800
 This was just my interpretation of Musashi's principles.

05:08.800 --> 05:16.800
